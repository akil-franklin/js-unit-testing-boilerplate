# JavaScript Unit Testing Boilerplate

_Description: Provides simple boilerplate for a typical JavaScript unit testing stack._


## Getting Started
This project relies on the following frameworks:

- [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) - JS testing framework
- [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) - BDD/TDD Assertion Library
- [Chai Things](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/Chai-Things) - Adds support for assertions on array elements to Chai
- [Angular](https://angularjs.org/)- To show examples of unit testing Angular
- [Angular Mocks](https://github.com/angular/bower-angular-mocks) - Supports mocking of Angular objects


These dependencies can be installed from the command line with npm and bower.

Install npm packages (**Note:** Chai Things is the only npm package... all the rest are Bower):
	
>	npm install

Install bower packages:

>	bower install


Once all of the dependencies are installed, you can view the test runner by browsing to index.html

##Troubleshooting Tips
- If you are behind a corporate firewall (especially one that requires NTLM authentication), special setup may be required in order to get NPM and Bower to work.
